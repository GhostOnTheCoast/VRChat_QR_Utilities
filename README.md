# VRChat QR Code Utilities

## Description
This is a program to run along-side VRChat. It will automatically search photos taken in VRC for QR Codes and record them to a list.

There are several options: 
- Auto Open URL -> This checkbox will cause the program to automatically open the first URL decoded from the QR Code. (Default Off)
- Play Sound on QR Read -> This checkbox will cause Windows to play the "Asterisk" sound on successful decode of QR Code. (Default Off)
- VRCX Compatibility -> This checkbox causes the program to wait until VRCX Renames the file for decoding. (Default On)

There are also several buttons: 
- Scan Whole Directory -> Scans your entire VRChat picture directory and all sub directories and processes every file for QR Codes. *Note: This could take a very long time. *
- Save List to CSV -> This button saves the current list of URI objects to an HTML and CSV file in the directory of the EXE. They will be named QRCode.csv and QRCode.html. ***Note: These files will overwrite any existing ones ***
